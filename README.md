## Initial Requirements and Interview Findings

- Users can create conversations around assignments or other course content
- Users can access a public & private forums with the class or the professor, or their team (respectively)
- Users will be able to tag messages with a particular assignment or module
- Users can privately message students or groups
- Users @ message individuals or teams

The following [survey results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1U4Fa1motRzKF2liUU1iyU8bS-pHGopvPX86E_N0U2MU/edit#responses) were collected prior to the creation of this project. They were used to guide our implementation direction, which was to facilitate better communication between students, their peers, and their professors throughout the application.

## Contextual Inquiry Notes

For our contextual inquiries, we observed two individuals as they accessed Canvas and navigated the system. We thought it would be helpful to have the people we observed simply talk through their thought processes and specify any frustrations or preferences as they went about their work. If they did anything particularly interesting, we would ask about why they chose to do it that way. The following are our observations:

Contextual Inquiry 1 Notes:
- User is checking grades and upcoming assignments for 2 classes, doesn’t navigate to the calendar at any point, rather just goes to the class then the “Assignment” tab for each course.
- User always needs to spend an extra step clicking away from the course syllabus page, which is the default for both of the courses.
- User checks the average grade for the assignments for both courses.
- User doesn’t use Canvas to communicate with teammates - prefers to use a Discord group chat.

Contextual Inquiry 2 Notes:
- User opens calendar to view all of their assignments at once
- User selects an assignment but then navigates to module section to gain the full info on the assignment
- User opens discord to discuss with classmates about group assignment
